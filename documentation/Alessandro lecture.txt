Use my for for trying different combinations of the optimization last proposed by Alessandro. I.e., for every grid step try to optimize.
Install optimization toolbox.

- How to define hidden nodes?
- Stop the simulator when a lost happens
- Chain effect
- Graph theory. Shout to make other nodes listen to me. A->B->C->A
- CTS/RTS

Post-processing hidden nodes combinations in python or java --> avoid hashmaps in C++

Start with sum matrices
		A	B	C	D	E
Loss1	-	1	0	0	1
Loss2	-	1	0	0	1
Loss3	-	0	1	1	1
Sum		-	2	1	1	3

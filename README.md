# WLAN-CTMC-DSA

Continuous Time Markov Network (CTMN) framework for analyzing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) implementing Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) and Dynamic Channel Bonding (DCB) policies.

### Installation

Just [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) is required.

### Usage
 
 * Set the system WLANs' scenario and configuration in files "wlans_input.csv" and "constants_script.m". 
 * Run main file "main_ctmn_dsa_analysis.m" to display the analysis results.
 * (*) New DCB policies may be defined in file "apply_dsa_policy.m".

### Support

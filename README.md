# Spatial Flexible Continuous Time Markov Network (SFCTMN)

Continuous Time Markov Network (CTMN) framework for analyzing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) implementing Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) and Dynamic Channel Bonding (DCB) policies.

### Installation

Just [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) is required.

### Usage
 
 * Set the system WLANs' scenario and configuration in files "wlans_input.csv", "constants_script.m" and "system_conf.m". 
 * Run main file "main_sfctmn.m" to display the analysis results.
 * (*) New DCB policies may be defined in file "apply_dsa_policy.m".
